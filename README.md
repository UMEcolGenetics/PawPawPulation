## Introduction

This repository contains general examples of commonly used ecological genetic methods, it is a meta-methods-review repository of sorts. Workflows and softwares commonly used in ecological genetics research are demonstrated here. The purpose in designing this directory was to establish a one-stop-shop for anyone looking to familiarize themselves with ecological genetic methods and for those considering what analyses to use in their research.

A microsatellite dataset considering influences of dispersal of the North American native *Asimina triloba* is used in each method demonstration[^fn1].

This repo was built out by graduate students/candidates at the University of Memphis as part of their final Ecological Genetics course (BIOL 8752/7752) during Fall 2021. 

## Concepts/Analyses

Below are a list of methods with links to each wiki. These analyses were chosen based on some of the most common methods used in 

### Analysis of MOlecular VAriance (AMOVA)

AMOVA is a popular method to use for calculating F-statistics for the presence of hierarchical population structure when your dataset has three or more populations[^fn2]. An AMOVA will compare molecular variance across the different strata (i.e., populations in this case) and look to see if the population means differ from one another.

### Bottleneck

### Barrier

### Fixation Index (F<sub>ST</sub>)

### Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is fundamental to populations genetics, and states that in the absence of influence by outside forces, genotype frequencies in a population will remain unchanged between generations[^fn3]. This principle has become an instrumental part of population genetics and is used to identify genetic structure in populations and instances of non-random mating.

### Identity by Descent (IBD)

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 

### Linkage Disequalibrium (LD)

Linkage disequilibrium (LD), sometimes referred to as gametic phase disequilibrium, occurs when alleles of two or more loci (or genes) show nonrandom association in a population[^fn4]. When two loci are considered linked, or their inheritance is correlated, one may influence the evolutionary trajectory of the other locus/loci. This may occur either from their physical proximity on the chromosome or from a functional association.


### Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)

### Structure 

Population structure (or genetic structure) refers to differences in allele frequencies between populations due to non-random mating between individuals. Non-random mating may be caused by inbreeding, assortative mating, and separation due to distance and geographic barriers. In these circumstances, genetic and phenotypic differences can accumulate between populations. Another consequence of population structure is reduced heterozygosity, as alleles have a higher chance to reach fixation within smaller subpopulations.

Studying population structure is important for understanding patterns of gene flow and inferring the demographic histories of populations. Once population structure for a species is known, it is possible to deduce the origins of unknown individuals and infer the presence of migration and admixture between subpopulations.

# Need help?
We want to make it super-easy for Snowplow users and contributors to talk to us and connect with each other, to share ideas, solve problems and help make PawPawPulaion an awesome resource. Here are the main channels we're running currently, we'd love to hear from you on one of them:

# GitHub
If you spot any issues please raise an issue in the GitHub repository of the analysis in question. Furthermore if you have run an analysis not detailed here or you have improved an existing workflow, with the pawpaw data, please open a pull request and we'll be glad to consider your analysis for integration in the project!
