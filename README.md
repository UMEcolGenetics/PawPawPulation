## Introduction

This repository contains general examples of commonly used ecological genetic methods; a meta-methods repository of sorts. Workflows and softwares commonly used in ecological genetics research are demonstrated here. The purpose in designing this directory was to establish a one-stop-shop for anyone looking to familiarize themselves with ecological genetic methods. 

A microsatellite dataset considering influences of dispersal of the North American native *Asimina triloba* is used in each method demonstration[^fn].

This repo was built out by graduate students/candidates at the University of Memphis as part of their final Ecological Genetics course (BIOL 8752/7752) during Fall 2021.
